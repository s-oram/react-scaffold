# Welcome to Remix + Vite!

ðŸ“– See the [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs) and the
[Remix Vite docs](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/guides/vite) for details on
supported features.

## Typegen

Generate types for your Cloudflare bindings in `wrangler.toml`:

```sh
pnpm run typegen
```

You will need to rerun typegen whenever you make changes to `wrangler.toml`.

## Development

Run the Vite dev server:

```sh
pnpm run dev
```

To run Wrangler:

```sh
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

## Deployment

> [!WARNING] Cloudflare does _not_ use `wrangler.toml` to configure deployment
> bindings. You **MUST** [configure deployment bindings manually in the
> Cloudflare dashboard][bindings].

First, build your app for production:

```sh
pnpm run build
```

Then, deploy your app to Cloudflare Pages:

```sh
pnpm run deploy
```
